# Notes using Kali on a Raspberry Pi 2

###Set-up and install
1. Download and validate the SHA1 on the Kali Linux ARM <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/">Downloads</a> page.  Further steps are available <a href="http://docs.kali.org/kali-on-arm/install-kali-linux-arm-raspberry-pi">here</a>
2. Recommended that you use a Linux machine to ready the micro SD card.  
3. Once it's good to go, insert it into the Raspberry Pi 2.  
4. Make sure to also change the SSH host keys <a href="http://docs.kali.org/kali-on-arm/install-kali-linux-arm-raspberry-pi">here</a>
5. Add another user to the group so that you don't use this as root.

What else..

###More notes to come...
**First impression**
The micro SD card that I have could barely hold the additional space that I will eventually need so it looks like I will need to start trimming it down.  Offensive Security offers the Kali Raspberry Pi image for those that want to tinker with it.
